### Ad Blocker in dwb

In order to use adblock feature, you will need to provide dwb with block lists.

To do so, copy the file /usr/local/bin/dwb_grab_adblocker.bash somewhere you can edit it,
modify it to your liking and run it. 

The script will fetch blocklists and convert them into format suitable for dwb.

Follow the instructions displayed after the script has completed to enable adblocker functionality.

### Extension manager

Dwb comes with command dwbem which will fetch various extensions to the browser. 

One of them is a script that will play flash videos through quvi with media player of your choice.

### Known issues

Note: if you are getting "SSL Handshake failed" messages on https websites,
edit the file ~/.config/dwb/settings and add/alter the following line 

ssl-use-system-ca-file=false

Alternatively, you change this option from config menu available after typing in "Ss" command in dwb, or by going to "dwb:settings" address.
