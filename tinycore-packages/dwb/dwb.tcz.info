Comments:       dwb is a webkit-based, keyboard-driven browser. It can support user scripts and has an built-in advertisement blocker feature.

For more information on additional features, refer to /usr/local/doc/dwb/readme file.

Note: if you are getting "SSL Handshake failed" messages on https websites,
edit the file ~/.config/dwb/settings and add/alter the following line 

ssl-use-system-ca-file=false

Alternatively, you change this option from config menu available after typing in "Ss" command in dwb, or by going to "dwb:settings" address.
